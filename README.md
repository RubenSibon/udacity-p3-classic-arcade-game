Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

# Vlogger (Classic Arcade Game)

In the never-ending hunt for more views and fame an ambitious vlogger tries the most daring thing yet: while holding a camcorder cross a busy road and jump into a river. Live! How can it possibly end well?

Test your reflexes and nerves in this HTML 5 Canvas game reboot of the classic arcade game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger), originally developed by [Konami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami) and distributed by [Sega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega) in 1981.

## How to run

The game is hosted on this webpage. Simply visit it to start playing.

## How to play

Does a classic game like Vlogger really need an explanation? Well, here it is anyway.

The goal of the game is simple: get your character (Vlogger) safely in the river on the other side of the road.

Vlogger starts at the bottom of the level. Vehicles and other objects travel the road. Be careful to not let them hit Vlogger as you make your way to the river as it will result in the loss of a heart. If all hearts are gone it'll be GAME OVER!

Vlogger can be moved with the four arrow keys. By pressing one of these keys the character moves one tile in the appropriate direction.
