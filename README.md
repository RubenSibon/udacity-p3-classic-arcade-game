# Vlogger (Classic Arcade Game Clone)

In the never-ending hunt for more views and fame an ambitious vlogger tries the most daring thing yet: cross a busy road and jump into a river while vlogging about it. Live! How can it possibly end well?

Test your reflexes and nerves in this HTML 5 Canvas game reboot of the classic arcade game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger), originally developed by [Konami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami) and distributed by [Sega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega) in 1981.

This game is unfinished. Stay tuned for feature updates. But be warned that they may never come. ;-)

## How to play

Does a classic game like (Fr)(Vl)ogger really need an explanation? Well, here it is anyway.

The goal of the game is simple: get your character (Vlogger) safely in the river on the other side of the road.

Vlogger starts at the bottom of the level. Vehicles and other objects travel the road. Be careful to not let them hit Vlogger as you make your way to the river as it will result in the loss of a heart. If all hearts are gone it'll be GAME OVER!

Vlogger can be moved with the four arrow keys. By pressing one of these keys the character moves one tile in the appropriate direction.
